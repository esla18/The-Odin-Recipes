        <h3>The traditional bulgarian pastry</h3>
        <p>Banitsa is a traditional pastry dish made in Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Serbia, prepared by layering a mixture of whisked eggs, natural yogurt and pieces of white brined cheese between filo pastry and then baking it in an oven. </p>
        <p>Traditionally, lucky charms are put into the pastry on certain occasions, particularly on New Year's Eve. These charms may be coins or small symbolic objects (e.g., a small piece of a dogwood branch with a bud, symbolizing health or longevity). More recently, people have started writing happy wishes on small pieces of paper and wrapping them in tin foil. Wishes may include happiness, health, or success throughout the new year (similar to fortune cookies). </p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees, (glass pyrex pan works great for this recipe) brush melted butter all over bottom amd sides of baking pan.</li>
            <li>Mix salt, cheese and milk and eggsin a bowl , combine and stir ingredients well.</li>
            <li>Put down 5 sheets of phyllo dough down in buttered pan and brush over with melted butter. You can also put down one sheet at a time and butter separately.</li>
            <li>Pour enough of the mixture to cover phyllo sheets and top with 3 more sheets.</li>
            <li>Continue to repeat the process: put down 3 sheets and make sure to brush them well with butter then layer with mixture until all of the mixture is done, then cover with atleast 2 sheets. I preffer not to butter the top sheets as they tend to get very hard after the banitsa is done baking.</li>
            <li>Bake for 25-35 minutes or until golden, make sure mixture is cooked in the middle by cutting into banitsa. When the mixture is cooked it will not be runny.</li>
            <li>Once banitsa is done cover it with either a towell or the lid to the pan and let it sit and cool before cutting it or serving. Covering it lets the steam soften the phyllo dough sheets.</li>
