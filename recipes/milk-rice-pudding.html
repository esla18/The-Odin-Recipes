        <h3>My all times favorite dessert</h3>
        <p>Old-Fashioned Rice Pudding is so creamy with the perfect texture and sweetness. Only a handful of ingredients and a little patience are needed to make this old time favorite dessert.</p>
        <p>The key to this rice pudding is a very high ratio of milk (a full 6 cups) to rice (just 1/2 cup). You may think when you start that there is no way it will thicken up enough but it magically does.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large saucepan, combine 5 1/2 cups milk, sugar, and salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Stir in rice and reduce heat to low. Be sure to adjust the heat so that it is at a gentle simmer.</li>
            <li>Stirring occasionally, cook for 50 to 60 minutes. Mixture should thicken up to consistency of yogurt.</li>
            <li>Once thickened, remove from heat and stir in vanilla.</li>
            <li>Let cool and then refrigerate. The last 1/2 cup milk is stirred in just before serving. Sprinkle with cinnamon if desired.</li>
        </ol>
